A modified version of Jazzy's default Apple theme, to resemble Apple's updated documentation style (as of November 2017).

This theme deviates a bit from the exact Apple style, to accommodate for the difference in style between how Apple and most open source libraries tend to be documented.

The "Overview" portion as seen in Apple's documentation is usually not as extensive, with most documentation being either part of separate "Guides", or attached to individual methods, so expandable method documentation is present in this section, similar to other Jazzy themes.

In keeping with a single column layout for the main content, the table of contents is shown below the article contents.
